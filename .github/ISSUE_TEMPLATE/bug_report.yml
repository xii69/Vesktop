              **Thanks ü©∑ for taking the time to fill out this bug report! Before proceeding, please read the following**

              Make sure a similar issue doesn't already exist by [searching the existing issues](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for keywords!

              Make sure both Vesktop and Vencord are fully up to date. You can update Vencord by right-clicking the Vesktop tray icon and pressing "Repair Vencord"

              **DO NOT REPORT** any of the following issues:
              - Purely graphical glitches like flickering, scaling issues[^1]
              - App crashing / not showing window with mentions of the gpu process in the stacktrace[^1]
              - Screenshare not starting, black screening or crashing[^2]
              - Vencord related issues: This is the Vesktop repo, not Vencord
              - Captchas[^3]
              - Issues with opening URLs[^4]
              - Issues with Notifications[^4]
              - Issues with Input Methods[^4]
              - Issues with File Drag and Drop[^5] 
              - Network Errors[^6]

              Linux users: Please only report issues with supported packages (flatpak and any builds from the README / releases).
              We do not support other packages, like the AUR or Nix packages, so please first make sure your issue is reproducible with official releases,
              like [our Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/dev.vencord.Vesktop) or [AppImage](https://vencord.dev/download/vesktop/amd64/appimage)


              [^1]: GPU issue. Disable hardware acceleration in Vesktop Settings or run with `--disable-gpu`
              [^2]: System issue. You will have to fix it
              [^3]: If you are receiving a lot of captchas, it means Discord thinks you might be a bot. Make sure you're not using a VPN/Proxy
              [^4]: These things are handled by Chromium / Electron, not us. If they don't work, it's either an issue with your system or a bug with Chromium.
              [^5]: You are likely using the Vesktop flatpak and trying to drop a file the flatpak can't access. You can fix this by installing Flatseal and using it to grant Vesktop full access to your files
              [^6]: Issue on your end, you have to fix it. Try changing your DNS to [1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/)
